# Laboratory 1 : Memory and Register Tracing, Loading and Storage

<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>

Tracing the memory and registers of the 8086 Architecture is an important skill to understand the
flow of data and instruction from memory to CPU. In a way providing visualization of the Random
Access Machine (RAM) model from the perspective of the 8086 architecture.

<strong>LEARNING OUTCOMES:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Declare the variables of the 8086 processor based on the indicated memory map.
</li>
<li>Retrieve load memory items into register and store register items into memory.</li>
</ul>
